# Process Scanner

A simple Windows program that scans for a process by its name and prints its Process ID (PID) if found. If the process is not found, it notifies the user.

## Features

- Scans through all currently running processes.
- Compares each process with the target process name.
- Prints the Process ID (PID) of the target process if found.
- Notifies the user if the target process is not running.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Compiler**: MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) or MinGW
- **Windows SDK**: For the `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` and process enumeration APIs.

## How It Works

The program uses the Windows API `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` to take a snapshot of all running processes. It iterates through each process and compares the executable name against the target process name provided by the user. If a match is found, it prints the PID of the process; otherwise, it prints a "not found" message.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/process-scanner.git
   cd process-scanner
   ```

2. **Compile the Program**:

   Use your preferred compiler. Here's an example with `gcc` from MinGW:

   ```bash
   gcc -o scanner Injection.c -lkernel32 -luser32
   ```

   Alternatively, with Visual Studio:

   - Open the project in Visual Studio.
   - Build the solution (Ctrl + Shift + B).

3. **Run the Program**:

   ```bash
   scanner.exe <ProcessName>
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   scanner.exe notepad.exe
   ```

   Output:
   ```bash
   Great! We found the process: notepad.exe with PID: 1234
   ```

   If the process is not found, it will display:

   ```bash
   Process: notepad.exe not found.
   ```

## Code Example

Hereâ€™s a code snippet from the program:

```c
HANDLE hSnapshot = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);
if (hSnapshot == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
    return 1;
}

PROCESSENTRY32 Proc;
Proc.dwSize = sizeof(PROCESSENTRY32);

if (!Process32First(hSnapshot, &Proc)) {
    CloseHandle(hSnapshot);
    return 1;
}

do {
    if (wcscmp(Proc.szExeFile, TargetName) == 0) {
        PID = Proc.th32ProcessID;
        wprintf(L"Great! We found the process: %ls with PID: %ld\n", TargetName, PID);
        found = TRUE;
        break;
    }
} while (Process32Next(hSnapshot, &Proc));
```

## Error Handling

- The program checks if the process snapshot is valid.
- If the process is not found, a helpful message is printed to the user.
