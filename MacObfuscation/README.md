### **MACfuscation**

# MACfuscation

## Overview

The `MACfuscation` directory provides a practical example of how MAC addresses can be obfuscated to evade detection in network traffic analysis. This example demonstrates how to manipulate MAC addresses into a format that is less recognizable by standard inspection tools, which can be used in various network evasion techniques.

## Files Included

- **`MACfuscation.vcxproj`**: Visual Studio project file for building the MAC address obfuscation example.
- **`MACfuscation.vcxproj.filters`**: Visual Studio filters file for the MAC address obfuscation project.
- **`MACfuscation.cpp`**: Source code implementing the MAC address obfuscation and potential injection technique.
- **`.gitattributes`**: Git attributes file for defining repository settings.
- **`.gitignore`**: Git ignore file to specify files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **`README.md`**: This README file.

## Implementation

### `MACfuscation.cpp`

This file contains the implementation for obfuscating MAC addresses and demonstrates a basic form of network evasion.

#### Key Components

- **`obfuscateMAC` Function**: This function takes a MAC address as input and applies an obfuscation method to transform the address into a less recognizable format. The obfuscation can include encoding, splitting, or rearranging bytes.
  
- **`main` Function**: The main entry point of the application, where the MAC address is obfuscated and optionally used in a network packet or shellcode to demonstrate evasion.

## Building the Project

To build the MAC obfuscation example:

1. **Open the Solution**:
   - Open `MalwareEvasionTechniques.sln` in Visual Studio.

2. **Build the Project**:
   - Build the solution using the appropriate configuration (Debug/Release).

3. **Run the Executable**:
   - Execute the compiled binary to test the MAC address obfuscation technique.

## Usage

Compile and run the `MACfuscation.cpp` file to observe how the obfuscation transforms the MAC addresses:

```bash
MACfuscation.exe PID
```
