# XOR Encryption

## Overview

The `XOR_encryption` directory provides a practical example of XOR encryption used to obfuscate payloads, which can be helpful in understanding basic malware evasion techniques. This example demonstrates how to use XOR encryption to hide the contents of a shellcode and how to inject it into a target process.

## Files Included

- **`XOR_encryption.vcxproj`**: Visual Studio project file for building the XOR encryption example.
- **`XOR_encryption.vcxproj.filters`**: Visual Studio filters file for the XOR encryption project.
- **`XorMalwareEnc.cpp`**: Source code implementing XOR encryption and shellcode injection.
- **`.gitattributes`**: Git attributes file for defining repository settings.
- **`.gitignore`**: Git ignore file to specify files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **`README.md`**: This README file.

## Implementation

### `XorMalwareEnc.cpp`

This file contains the implementation for XOR encryption and the injection of obfuscated shellcode into a target process. Here’s a breakdown of the functionality:

- **XOR Encryption**: The payload is encrypted using XOR encryption with a key. The encryption function XORs each byte of the payload with a key value modified by its position.
- **Shellcode Injection**: The decrypted shellcode is injected into the target process's memory and executed using a remote thread.

#### Key Components

- **`xorEncryptDecrypt` Function**: This function performs XOR encryption and decryption. It takes a pointer to the shellcode, its size, and a key. The function XORs each byte of the shellcode with the key (modified by the byte’s index).

- **`decryptShellcode` Function**: This function calls `xorEncryptDecrypt` to decrypt the shellcode and writes it to the target process’s memory.

- **`main` Function**: This is the entry point of the application. It opens a handle to the target process, allocates memory in the process for the shellcode, writes the decrypted shellcode into the allocated memory, and creates a remote thread to execute the shellcode.


### VirusTotal Analysis

To showcase the effectiveness of XOR encryption, screenshots from VirusTotal are included. These screenshots demonstrate the difference in detection rates before and after applying XOR encryption.

## Building the Project

To build the XOR encryption example:

1. **Open the Solution**:
   - Open `MalwareEvasionTechniques.sln` in Visual Studio.

2. **Build the Project**:
   - Build the solution using the appropriate configuration (Debug/Release).

3. **Run the Executable**:
   - Execute the compiled binary and provide the process ID (PID) as a command-line argument to inject the shellcode.

## Usage

Compile and run the `XorMalwareEnc.cpp` file with the target process ID to test the XOR encryption and shellcode injection:

```bash
XorMalwareEnc.exe <PID>
```
