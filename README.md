## Overview

Welcome to the `MalwareEvasionTechniques` repository! This project is a growing collection of malware evasion techniques that I am learning and implementing. The techniques in this repository are designed to bypass various detection mechanisms like debuggers,EDRs,AVs, sandboxes, and other security defenses.

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and provide examples of different evasion strategies for educational purposes. The repository will be regularly updated as I explore new techniques.

## Techniques Included

This repository currently includes the following evasion techniques, with more to come:

- **Anti-Debugging**: Techniques to detect and evade debuggers.
  - `AntiDebugging-SimpleFunc`: A simple anti-debugging function.
  - `AntiDebugging_Using_PEB`: Anti-debugging using the Process Environment Block (PEB).

- **Self-Deletion**: Methods that allow a malware sample to delete itself after execution.
  - `Self_delete`: Example of a self-deleting executable.

- **Custom Error Handling**: Using custom error handling for evasion.
  - `CustomError`: Examples of evasion using custom error handling routines.
- **XOR encryption**: Using XOR encryption for evasion.
  - `XorEncryption`: Examples of evasion using xor encryption.
- **Ipv4Obfuscation**: Using IPV4 to obfuscate the Shellcode for evasion.
- **Ipv6Obfuscation**: Using IPV6 to obfuscate the Shellcode for evasion.
- **MacObfuscation**: Using MacAdresses to obfuscate the Shellcode for evasion.
- **Remote Process Scanner**: Using CreateToolHelp32Snapshot to scan the remote processes.
- **Web Stager**: Using a C2 server to download the Shellcode.
- **Registry Stager**: Using Windows registry to hide shellcode.
- 
### Upcoming Techniques


This repository will continue to expand as I learn more. Here are some of the topics I plan to explore:

- **Code Obfuscation**
- **Memory Evasion Techniques**
- **Process Injection**
- **Environment Detection**
- **Encryptions**

Stay tuned for updates!

## Installation

To set up and run the examples in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdouRoumi/MalwareEvasionTechniques.git
   ```

2. **Open the Solution**:
   - Open `MalwareEvasionTechniques.sln` in Visual Studio.

3. **Build the Solution**:
   - Build the solution using the appropriate configuration (Debug/Release).

4. **Run the Executables**:
   - Execute the compiled binaries to observe the malware evasion techniques in action.

## Usage

Each directory contains a specific evasion technique with relevant source code. You can explore the code, build it, and run it to see how the evasion works. The code is documented to help you understand the logic behind each technique.

```markdown
# Example
cd Self_delete
# Open the solution and build the project
```
